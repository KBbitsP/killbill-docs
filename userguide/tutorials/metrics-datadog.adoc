= Managing Metrics with Datadog

:imagesdir: https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws


== Overview

Several third party tools are available to manage and display Kill Bill's metrics. One popular tool is https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog]. This
package offers a low-cost option to monitor and display whatever metrics
you may find useful from the Kill Bill collection, including metrics
that show the performance and resource use of Kill Bill and Kaui
themselves, and metrics describing the infrastructure on which these
systems run.

Datadog can be integrated with several types of Kill Bill installations. In this document we discuss the use of Datadog to manage metrics produced
by single-tier and multi-tier implementations on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
With the latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
for Kill Bill, the application is preconfigured to collect these metrics and to direct them to Datadog once authorization is provided.

 
== Set Up Datadog

You may already be familiar with Datadog. If not, this section will
explain how to get started.

First, go to the https://www.datadoghq.com/[Datadog website]. Datadog
offers a free trial to get started. After the trial, you will be charged
monthly depending on what types of information you want them to manage.
To sign up for the free trial, select "GET STARTED FREE" at the top of
the page.

When you login to Datadog you will be taken to the Welcome page. Note
the series of menu options on the left hand side.

To set up Datadog to manage the metrics available from Kill Bill, there
are just two steps: (1) install the Datadog agent in Kill Bill, and (2)
authorize the transfer of the complete Kill Bill metrics.

== Install the Agent

The first step in integrating an analysis tool (like Datadog) and a
source of data to analyze (like Kill Bill) is to set up a means to get
the source to send its data to the analyzer. Datadog does this by
installing the *Datadog Agent* in the system producing the data.

1. In the main Datadog menu, select *Integrations*. 
2. Scroll down in the submenu to select *Agent*. This shows you a page listing all of the
platforms on which the Datadog Agent can be installed. 
3. Choose *Ubuntu*. The next page shows you the single step required for this platform
to install the agent:

To install the agent: 

1. Login to your EC2 instance. 
2. Copy the line shown by Datadog to the Ubuntu command line. 
3. Press Enter. The agent should be installed automatically.

[NOTE]
This command already includes the API key assigned to you by
Datadog. This authorizes the agent to do its job.

If you are using the Multitier installation, you will have multiple EC2
instances. The agent should be installed separately for each one.

To test the installation, return to datadog and choose *Infrastructure*,
then *Infrastructure List* from the left menu. The table that appears
should list all of your hosts and indicate their status as *ACTIVE*. You
may need to wait a few minutes for the table to appear.

Now select *Metrics*, then *Summary* from the menu. You should see a
long list of metrics! These are coming from your instances, but they
only describe the Ubuntu environment itself. You do not yet have the
Kill Bill metrics. To fix this, proceed to the next step.

== Set Up the Authorization

To authorize the sending of the Kill Bill metrics, it is necessary to
edit two lines in this file:

```
/var/lib/tomcat/bin/setenv2.sh`
```

This file contains configuration information for `tomcat`, which manages the
KillBill web applications.

This is a small file. The two lines to be edited are:

```
-Dcom.killbill.datadog.enable=false
-Dcom.killbill.datadog.apiKey=
```

These should be changed to:

```
-Dcom.killbill.datadog.enable=true
-Dcom.killbill.datadog.apiKey=Your-API-Key
```

The API key to be added is the same one contained in the command you
used to install the agent.

After editing the file, go to your AWS EC2 dashboard and *reboot the
instance* so the new configuration file will be read. If you have more
than one instance, follow the same procedure for each one.

Now return to the *Metrics/Summary* page. After a short delay, you
should see a lot more metricsâ€”well over 1,000 in your list.

Congratulations. Your Datadog integration is complete!

== Using Datadog

The Datadog site has lots of https://docs.datadoghq.com/[documentation], so we won't
repeat any of that here. We will just suggest a few quick steps to get
started:

. Go to *Metrics* in the menu and *Explorer* in the submenu. Click on
the field labeled *Graph:* to get a dropdown list of all available
metrics.
. Select some metrics to see the graph they produce. Identify the ones
you would like to see together in a dashboard.
. Gather the names of the metrics you want in the *Graph:* field
together.
. Under *Export these graphs to:* select *New Dashboard*. Give your
dashboard a name.

Your dashboard will appear in the *Dashboard List* under the
*Dashboards* menu item. You can create and modify multiple dashboards.
You can also adjust the graphs in many ways, and do lots of other things
like setting alarms. Have fun and good luck!
