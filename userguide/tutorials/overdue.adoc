= Overdue System

[[intro]]

In this tutorial, we look a little bit deeper into Kill Bill's payment retry system and the overdue system. The main https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[subscription userguide] already explains some basics about these systems. This tutorial will show you how they work in practice.

== Pre-requisites

* Ensure that you have configured Kill Bill, Kaui and the database as explained in the http://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html[Getting Started] document.
* Ensure that you have set up a tenant configured with API key `bob` and API secret `lazar`.
* Ensure that the `org.killbill.server.test.mode=true` property is set which allows to move the clock through time
* Ensure that you have gone through the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[Subscription UserGuide] and are familiar with catalogs, invoices, payments and other concepts.
* Ensure that you have https://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] installed. If you are on Windows, we recommend that you use https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git Bash] to run the `cURL` commands.

=== Scenario

Let's assume you want to build a website where your customers can subscribe to movies (similar to Netflix). For simplicity's sake, we will assume you only provide one $10/month plan for unlimited streaming. The plan will contain a 10 days trial period during which customers have unlimited access.

We now want to configure the overdue system (dunning) to take some actions when users don't pay:

1. The system should be configured to retry failed payments 4 times: the first two payment retries should happen 1 day after the last attempt, the third one should happen 8 days after previous attempt and the last one should happen 6 days after the previous attempt
2. The system should notify the user when an invoice has not been paid after 10 days (during which time the system already automatically retried 3 times)
3. The system should block the entitlements associated with the account after 14 days
4. The system should automatically cancel the subscriptions after 21 days

Additionally, we want to prevent users from changing plans (e.g. upgrade) until they clear their balance.

== Overdue and Payment Retry System Overview

Before we understand how to implement the above scenario, let us understand some high-level concepts.

Kill Bill has two distinct in-built mechanisms that come into play here, these are the *Payment Retry System* and the *Overdue System*. Though separate, these two systems work in close conjunction with each other.

The *Payment Retry System* is a system that retries failed payments as per a defined schedule. The schedule can be defined via a property in the Kill Bill configuration file or can be uploaded on a per-tenant basis. The scenario above states that the system should be configured to retry failed payments 4 times. So, the Payment Retry System needs to be configured accordingly. 

The *Overdue System* defines the flow that the system must follow when an account is overdue (that is, has an unpaid balance). It can be configured via an XML file. The XML file can be specified via a property in the Kill Bill configuration file or can be uploaded on a per-tenant basis. The XML file defines the various _states_ that the account must go through, the _change in the user's entitlements_ when the account is transitioned from one state to the other and the _period_ after which the state is re-evaluated. The scenario above states that the entitlements should be blocked after 14 days and the subscription should be cancelled after 21 days. So, this needs to be configured in the overdue XML file.

It is important to understand that the *Payment Retry System* and the *Overdue system* are *independent* of each other. So, the *Payment Retry System* attempts payments as per its retry schedule while the *overdue system* moves the account from one state to the other as per its configuration.

Having said that, most business cases would require using both the systems in conjunction with one another. For example, the scenario defined above requires attempting the payment 4 times as well as blocking the entitlements and changing the user's access when the balance is unpaid. So, we will need to configure both the *Payment Retry System* and the *Overdue system* in order to implement this scenario.

Let us now understand how to implement this scenario.

== Configuration of the System

=== Catalog Configuration

First of all, you will need to create a catalog. Your catalog will contain a plan entry that specifies two phases, one for the trial period of 10 days and one for the recurring monthly charge of $10:

[source,xml]

</catalog>
----

You can upload the catalog by hitting the following endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v \
-u 'admin:password' \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
-H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
-H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: stephane" \
-X POST \
-d @/VALID_PATH/catalog.xml \
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/catalog/xml"
----

In order to understand more about catalogs, you can refer to the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-catalog[subscription billing] document.

=== Overdue configuration

Next, you need to define the overdue configuration XML file. Based on the scenario defined above, the overdue configuration will define the three states the account will go through:

1. The account will enter the `WARNING` state 10 days after the first unpaid invoice (i.e. 20 days after the subscription creation)
2. 4 days later, the account will move to the `BLOCKED` state
3. 7 days later, the account will move to the `CANCELLATION` state.

You can create an XML file corresponding to this overdue configuration as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<overdueConfig>
   <accountOverdueStates>
       <initialReevaluationInterval>
           <unit>DAYS</unit><number>10</number>
       </initialReevaluationInterval>
       <state name="CANCELLATION">
           <condition>
               <timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds>
                   <unit>DAYS</unit><number>21</number>
               </timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds>
           </condition>
           <externalMessage>Reached CANCELATION</externalMessage>
           <subscriptionCancellationPolicy>END_OF_TERM</subscriptionCancellationPolicy>
       </state>
       <state name="BLOCKED">
           <condition>
               <timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds>
                   <unit>DAYS</unit><number>14</number>
               </timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds>
           </condition>
           <externalMessage>Reached BLOCKED</externalMessage>
           <blockChanges>true</blockChanges>
           <disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked>false</disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked>
           <autoReevaluationInterval>
               <unit>DAYS</unit><number>7</number>
           </autoReevaluationInterval>
       </state>
       <state name="WARNING">
           <condition>
               <timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds>
                   <unit>DAYS</unit><number>10</number>
               </timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds>
           </condition>
           <externalMessage>Reached WARNING</externalMessage>
           <blockChanges>true</blockChanges>
           <disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked>false</disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked>
           <autoReevaluationInterval>
               <unit>DAYS</unit><number>4</number>
           </autoReevaluationInterval>
       </state>
   </accountOverdueStates>
</overdueConfig>
----

In more details:

* `initialReevaluationInterval` is set to 10 (if no payment is posted, the overdue state is recomputed 10 days later to match `timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds`)
* `WARNING`:
** `timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds` is set to 10 days as specified by the scenario
** `blockChanges` is set to true to prevent users from changing plans
** `disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked` is set to false, since we still want the user to have access to the service
** `autoReevaluationInterval` is set to 4 days to make sure that if there is no payment (which would trigger a re-evaluation of the overdue state), the state will be correctly recomputed and transition to `BLOCKED` 4 days later
* `BLOCKED`:
** `blockChanges` is set to true to prevent users from changing plans
** `timeSinceEarliestUnpaidInvoiceEqualsOrExceeds` is set to 14 days as specified by the scenario
** `disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked` is also set to false. This configuration also has an impact on the billing so setting it to true would block the billing (and entitlement) from that date forward.
** `autoReevaluationInterval` is set to 8 days to make sure that if there is no payment (no overdue trigger), the state will be correctly recomputed and transition to `CANCELLATION` 8 days later
* `CANCELLATION`:
** `subscriptionCancellationPolicy` is set to `END_OF_TERM` to indicate that subscriptions should be cancelled in such a way that we do not generate credit for the account (no proration)


**Beware** The definition order of the states in the XML configuration file is important: You must have the first state at the bottom and then all the way up to the last state (as shown in our example).

This XML file can be specified as a property in the Kill Bill configuration file as follows:
[source,bash]
----
org.killbill.overdue.uri=file:///<path>/overdue.xml
----

Alternately, you can upload the overdue configuration on a per-tenant basis by hitting the following endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v \
-u 'admin:password' \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
-H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
-H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: stephane" \
-X POST \
-d @/VALID_PATH/overdue.xml \
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/overdue/xml"
----


=== Payment Retries System Configuration

The scenario defined above also requires the payments to be attempted 4 times with a gap of 1,1,8 and 6 days between attempts. Thus, the payment retry system needs to be configured as per this schedule. 


The payment retry schedule can be configured as a property in the Kill Bill configuration file as follows:
[source,bash]
----
org.killbill.payment.retry.days=1,1,8,6
----

Alternately, you can upload the payment retry schedule on a per-tenant basis by hitting the following endpoint:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v \
-u admin:password \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
-H 'X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar' \
-H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
-H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: stephane' \
-X POST \
--data-binary '{"org.killbill.payment.retry.days":"1,1,8,6"}' \
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/uploadPerTenantConfig"
----

Additionally, if you need more granularity in how you want to retry payments, you can implement your own logic in a https://docs.killbill.io/latest/payment_control_plugin.html[Payment Control Plugin] (which goes beyond the scope of this tutorial).

[[customers]]
== Some Customer Flows

Let us now take a look at some typical customer flows and understand how the payment retry system and overdue system will function. 

=== Flow 1 - Good Customer, No issue with payment

Let us first understand what happens when there is no issue with the payment:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/overdue/overdue-flow1.png[align=center]

Immediately after the customer subscribes, a $0 invoice is created to indicate the customer is in TRIAL. 10 days later, the customer moves out of TRIAL and the system generates a $10 invoice for the month. At this point, the system attempts to make a payment which is successful. 

So, in this case, the payment retry system *DOES NOT* kick-in.


=== Flow 2 - Good Customer, fixes payment issue during retry flow

Next, suppose the customer's credit card does not have enough funds to cover the payment initially but the customer fixes this issue later on:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/overdue/overdue-flow2.png[align=center]

As before, the system attempts a payment after the trial period. Since this payment fails, the payment retry system is activated. It first retries a payment *1* day later (on `2021-08-07`) and again retries a payment another day later( on `2021-08-08`). The customer then fixes his/her credit card issue on `2021-08-15`. The payment retry system which is scheduled to run again *8* days later runs on `2021-08-16`. At this point, the payment is successful, so no more payments are attempted.

=== Flow 3 - Good Customer, fixes payment issue during overdue flow

In the next scenario, let us see what happens when the customer fixes his/her credit card issue after the overdue flow has kicked in:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/overdue/overdue-flow3.png[align=center]

As before, the system attempts a payment after the trial period which fails. The payment retry system then attempts the payment after *1* day(on `2021-08-07`), again after *1* day(`2021-08-08`) and again after *8* days(on `2021-08-16`). At this point, 10 days have elapsed since the first unpaid invoice. So, the overdue system is activated which moves the account to the `WARNING` state.  After 4 days (that is on `2021-08-20`), the Overdue system runs again and moves the account to the `BLOCKED` state. The customer then fixes his/her credit card issue on `2021-08-21`. The payment retry system (which has already made *3* payment attempts), is scheduled to make one last payment attempt *6* days after the previous payment attempt. The previous payment attempt was on `2021-08-16` so the payment retry system attempts a payment on `2021-08-22`. Since the payment issue is now fixed, the payment is successful. So, the account is moved back to the `CLEAR` state.

=== Flow 4 - Bad Customer, does not fix payment issue

Let us now consider what happens when the customer is a bad customer and does not fix the payment issue:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/overdue/overdue-flow4.png[align=center]

This flow is quite similar to the previous flow. The Overdue System has already moved the account to the `BLOCKED` state on `2021-08-20`. Since the customer does not fix the payment issue, the payment fails when the payment retry system attempt it the fourth time on `2021-08-22`. The Overdue system is configured to run one more time after *7* day after the previous run. Since the Overdue system was previously run on `2021-08-20`, it runs on `2021-08-27` and moves the account to the `CANCELLATION` state. 

[[testing]]
== Configuring the Payment Test Plugin

In order to test the system, one must be able to make payments fail. For that purpose, we have created a https://github.com/killbill/killbill-payment-test-plugin[payment test plugin] that can be configured through an api  call to make payments fail. 

The plugin can be installed using any of the methods specified in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/plugin_development.html#_plugin_installation[plugin installation instructions].

For example, to install the plugin via https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/kpm[kpm], you need to run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kpm install_java_plugin 'payment-test' --destination="<path_to_install_plugin>"
----

== Testing the System

Now that we have everything ready, we can test the system. We will be simulating the following flow:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/overdue/overdue-test-flow.png[align=center]

So, we will be doing the following:

* Create an account
* Add default payment matching our test payment plugin
* Create a subscription
* Move the clock after the trial and observe first successful payment
* Configure payment plugin to fail payments
* Move the clock a month later and observe first failed payment
* Move clock +1 day and observe first payment retry
* Move clock +1 day and observe second payment retry
* Move clock +8 day and observe third payment retry and first overdue state `WARNING`
* Move clock +4 day and observe second overdue state `BLOCKED`
* Move clock +1 day and configure payment plugin to succeed
* Move clock +1 day (6 days from last payment attempt) and observe fourth payment retry which is successful

Notes: For simplicity, we are using dates (e.g `2021-01-10`) when manipulating the Kill Bill clock instead of fully qualified datetimes (`2021-01-10T01:43:23.000Z`). Passing such a date will end up moving the Kill Bill clock to a given point in time and that point in time may end up before the exact time of the event we are trying to trigger. In such case, retry moving the clock by one day and that should trigger it. An alternative is to specify the exact datetime when moving the clock, but that requires looking into Kill Bill internal tables to understand what is the exact trigger time. This is more rigorous but less convenient.

When a customer attempts to use the service, the web site *could* verify if the customer is entitled to receive the service:

1. It should first retrieve the overdue status (at the account level) using the `GET /1.0/kb/accounts/{accountId}/overdue` api
2. It should then retrieve the subscriptions associated with the account `GET /1.0/kb/accounts/{accountId}/bundles` (or if the subscriptionId was cached it could use `GET /1.0/kb/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`) to verify the individual subscriptions status

The endpoint `GET /1.0/kb/accounts/{accountId}/overdue` will return the following json:

[source,json]
----
{
  "blockChanges": true,
  "clearState": false,
  "daysBetweenPaymentRetries": 1,
  "disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked": false,
  "externalMessage": "Reached WARNING",
  "name": "WARNING",
  "reevaluationIntervalDays": 4
}
----

If the `disableEntitlementAndChangesBlocked` is set to true, it means that the customer is not entitled to the service associated to any subscriptions.

Note that retrieving subscriptions through the `GET /1.0/kb/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` will not directly indicate the overdue status, and so both calls must be made to have a complete picture of the entitlement when the overdue system has been configured.

When retrieving entitlement/overdue status, the web site could be implemented to take all kinds of actions such as displaying warning message, degrading experience, emailing customer, ...


=== Custom Plugins

In the previous section, we discussed a possible implementation where the web site queries the billing system to figure out the entitlement story attached to a customer (when he logs-in for instance). Another pattern is to create a custom notification plugin that will listen to `Overdue` events. In order to create a Java plugin, you can refer to this https://docs.killbill.io/latest/notification_plugin.html[tutorial]. If you would like to create a Ruby plugin, you can refer to the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-ruby-plugin/blob/master/lib/helloworld/user_listener.rb[Hello World Ruby Example]. The plugin would need to filter for `OVERDUE_CHANGE` https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/master/notification/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/notification/plugin/api/ExtBusEventType.java[events].

Such plugins can be used for the following purpose:

* Email/Notify user about the new state (We already have an https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin[email notification plugin] which can also be extended to handle `OVERDUE_CHANGE` events)
* Take action to modify the experience (based on the state name): for instance to degrade the service, modify the login flow to prompt for payment, ...
