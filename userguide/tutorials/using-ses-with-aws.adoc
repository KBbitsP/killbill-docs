# Setting Up an SMTP Server

The email plugin for Kill Bill requires an SMTP server. For implementations using AWS the best choice may be Amazon's *Simple Email Service (SES)*.

A full description of SES is available in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/Welcome.html[AWS documentation]. To setup an implementation suitable for Kill Bill, you need two main steps. First, you must obtain a set of SES SMTP credentials (username and password). Second, you must verify the identities of both your default sending address ("From" address) and of each adress you will be sending email to (this requirement will be removed later).

### Obtaining SMTP credentials

 1. Sign in to AWS.
 2. Go to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/sesv2/[SMTP dashboard]. You will see information about the SMTP server you are creating, including the fact that your server will be in the sandbox for your region. A sandbox server is easier to setup and suitable for development, but it places limits on how you can use the server. You can exit the sandbox later.
 3. Scroll to the bottom and click on *Create SMTP Credentials*.
 4. A brief form will appear. Accept the username and click *Create* at the bottom of the page.
 5. You will see a message that your user has been created successfully. Click on *show user SMTP security credentials* to display the generated username and password. These must be saved, as they will be required to be copied to the plugin configuration in a later step.
 6. Click *Download Credentials* to save your credentials in a comma-separated text file.
