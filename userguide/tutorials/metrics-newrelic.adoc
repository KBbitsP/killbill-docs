= Managing Metrics with New Relic

:imagesdir: https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws


== Single-Tier and Multi-Tier Implementations

Measurements and metrics are an important part of managing your Kill
Bill system to be sure that performance is optimized and any problems
can be detected early. Kill Bill collects over 1,300 metrics to show you
every conceivable view of your system's behavior.

Several third-party tools are available to manage and display metrics of
this type. One popular tool is https://www.newrelic.com/[New Relic]. This
package offers a low-cost option to monitor and display whatever metrics
you may find useful from the Kill Bill collection, including metrics
that show the performance and resource use of Kill Bill and Kaui
themselves, and metrics describing the infrastructure on which these
systems run.

New Relic can be integrated with several types of Kill Bill installations. In this guide we discuss the use of New Relic to manage metrics produced
by two types of implementations on Amazon Web Services (AWS):
single-tier and multi-tier. With the latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
for Kill Bill, it is very easy to direct the Kill Bill metrics to
New Relic and work with them in the way that best suits your needs.

== Check Your Kill Bill Version

We assume that you have a working Kill Bill implementation running on
AWS, using either the
https://docs.killbill.io/latest/aws-singletier.html[Single Tier] or
https://docs.killbill.io/latest/aws-multitier.html[Multitier]
installation options. The single-tier option runs Kill Bill, Kaui, the
MariaDB database, and the nginx load balancer on a single AWS EC2
instance. This is suitable for quick deployment and for testing and
development. The multi-tier option runs Kill Bill and Kaui on two or more
separate EC2 instances, and uses an AWS RDS database manager along with
an AWS load balancer. This is an attractive option for many production
uses.

You should be running Kill Bill version 2021.9 or later. This version
can be configured to provide its full collection of Kill Bill metrics to
New Relic (and several other analysis tools). If you open the Kill Bill
admin page in your browser, it should show that you are
running the "Kill Bill Premium edition":

If you see this page you are ready to go. If not, you should upgrade
your installation.

While you are on this page, if you want to see all the metrics that Kill
Bill has to offer, just add the path `/1.0/metrics` to the URL. Have fun!
If you find these hard to understand, though, maybe New Relic can help.

== Set Up New Relic

You may already be familiar with New Relic. If not, this section will
explain how to get started.

First, go to the https://www.newrelic.com/[New Relic website]. New Relic
offers a free account as long as your usage does not exceed certain limits. Provide a name and email address to sign up.

You should see the New Relic main page. To get back to this page at a future time you can click the words *New Relic One* in the upper left corner.

To set up New Relic to manage the metrics available from Kill Bill, there
are just two steps: (1) install the New Relic agent in Kill Bill, and (2)
edit a configuration file to enable the transfer of the complete Kill Bill metrics.

== Install the Agent

The first step in integrating an analysis tool (like New Relic) and a
source of data to analyze (like Kill Bill) is to set up a means to get
the source to send its data to the analyzer. New Relic does this by
installing the *New Relic Agent* in the system producing the data.

. In the main New Relic page, select the button labeled *Add Some Data*. If this button does not appear, select *+ Add More Data* in the upper right corner. 
. An overlay pane should appear. At the top of this pane select *Guided Install*.
. The next pane is headed *Installation Plan*. Make sure the *Auto-Discovery* tab is selected, then choose *Linux*.
. The next pane summarizes what you have selected. Click on *Begin Installation*. You will see the following page:

+

+

. In the box containing the install command, click *Copy Command*. The command will be copied to your clipboard.

+

[NOTE]
This command includes the API key assigned to you by
New Relic. This authorizes the agent to do its job. This is your *user* API Key, and should not be confused with the key you will use in the next step.

+

. To install the agent: 

.. Login to your EC2 instance. 
.. Paste the saved install command to the Ubuntu command line. 
.. Press Enter. The installation should begin.

+

You will be presented with a list of options to install, as shown below. An additional option, Infrastructure Agent, is always installed.

+

. Press Enter to select all of the options.

+

+

You will be presented with several questions including default answers.

+

. Press Enter after each question to select the defaults.

+

Finally, you will be asked for the MySQL password.

+

. Type `root`.

+

If all goes well, each installation should report `success`.

+


[NOTE]
*Note:* If you are using the multi-tier installation, you will have multiple EC2
instances. The agent should be installed separately for each one.

== Test the Installation

. Return to the New Relic main page. 
. Select *Browse Data* from the top menu. 
. Select *Metrics* from the dropdown.

You should see a
long list of metrics! These are coming from your instances, but they
only describe the Ubuntu environment itself. You do not yet have the
Kill Bill metrics. To fix this, proceed to the next section.

== Set Up the Authorization

To authorize the sending of the Kill Bill metrics, it is necessary to
edit two lines in this file:

 ```
 /var/lib/tomcat/bin/setenv2.sh
 ```

This file contains configuration information for `tomcat`, which manages the
KillBill web applications.

This is a small file. The two lines to be edited are:

```
-Dcom.killbill.newrelic.enable=false
-Dcom.killbill.newrelic.apiKey=
```

These should be changed to:

```
-Dcom.killbill.newrelic.enable=true
-Dcom.killbill.newrelic.apiKey=Your-API-Key
```

The API key to be added is called the *Insights Insert Key.* This is *not* the same as the user API Key contained in the command you
used to install the agent.

To find the Insights Insert Key:

1. Close any overlay panes on the New Relic page by clicking on the `X` in the upper right corner.
2. Click the symbol at the far upper right to open your account menu, then select *API keys*.
3. On the page that appears, select *Insights Insert keys* at the lower right.
4. In the *Insert Keys* column on the left, under the word *key* at the bottom, click *Show*.
5. Manually copy the key to your clipboard, then paste it to the configuration file.

After editing the file, go to your AWS EC2 dashboard and *reboot the
instance* so the new configuration file will be read. If you have more
than one instance, follow the same procedure for each one.

Now return to the *Metrics/Summary* page. After a short delay, you
should see a lot more metrics; well over 1,000 in your list.

Congratulations. Your New Relic integration is complete!

== Using New Relic

The New Relic site has lots of https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/[documentation], so we won't
repeat any of that here. We will just suggest a few quick steps to get
started:

1. Close any overlay panes on the New Relic page by clicking on the `X` in the upper right corner.
2. Select *Browse Data* in the menu and *Metrics* in the submenu. A list of available metrics will appear on the left.
3. Select some metrics to see the graph (chart) they produce. Identify the ones you would like to see together in a dashboard.
4. To create a dashboard, close the metrics page, select *Dashboards* in the menu, and click *+ Create a Dashboard*.
5. Select *Create New Dashboard*, give it a name, and click *Create*.

You can add charts to your dashboard for any metrics you choose. The charts can be edited, deleted, and rearranged. Your dashboard will appear under the *Dashboards* menu item. Have fun and good luck!
