= Set Up Kill Bill Using Kaui

This section explains how to configure a tenant using Kaui, the back-office user interface.

As part of getting familiar with Kaui, we'll walk you through the steps of setting up a simple catalog, followed by creating an account in Kaui. Next, you'll learn how to assign a payment method to the account and subscribe the account to a plan. Finally, you'll be able to view the generated invoice and payment.

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have https://docs.killbill.io/latest/install-kb-and-kaui.html[installed Kill Bill and Kaui]. 

[NOTE]
*Note:* You can also achieve these same results of this tutorial with the API. For more information, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/set-up-kb-with-the-api.html[Set Up Kill Bill with the API].

== About Tenants

 The tenant represents a logical Kill Bill deployment running on a (set of) physical servers. An organization typically chooses to use a tenant to represent, for example, a department or division or sales territory. An organization can have more than one tenant, as Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy.

=== Setup Using Kill Bill Admin UI (KAUI)

Go to http://127.0.0.1:9090[http://127.0.0.1:9090]. You will be prompted for a username and password. Both Kill Bill and Kaui support role based access control (RBAC), where you can configure fine-grained permissions for your users. The default set of credentials is `admin`/`password`, which grants full access.

Because Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy (where each tenant has its own data, configuration, etc.), the next step is to create your own tenant. We will assume the api key is `bob` and api secret `lazar` in the rest of this guide.

==== Modifying the Catalog

The Kill Bill *catalog* contains products and plans definitions. This XML configuration file is really powerful and offers various options for handling trials, add-ons, upgrades/downgrades, etc. For more details on its features, read the http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[Subscription Billing manual].

For basic use cases, Kaui also lets you configure *simple* (subset of what is supported through XML configuration) plans through the UI, so you don't have to generate the catalog XML manually. This is available on your tenant configuration page, that you can access by clicking on your tenant name at the top right corner of every Kaui page.

For this tutorial, create 2 plans: *standard-free* (free plan) and *standard-monthly* (premium plan), associated with a single `Standard` product (the product category is `BASE`). We could have just defined standard-monthly, but that way you could make free users subscribe to the free plan. This is useful for reporting for example (to track how long it took to upsell them, etc.)

Note that we haven't defined any trial period.

==== Creating Your First Account

We will assume that users going to your site have to create an account in your system. When they do, you will need to create a mirrored *account* in Kill Bill.

To do so in Kaui, click the CREATE NEW ACCOUNT link at the top of the page.

Notes:

* The Kill Bill *External key* field should map to the unique id of the account in your system (should be unique and immutable). Kill Bill will auto-generate an id if you don't populate this field
* There are many more fields you can store (phone number, address, etc.) -- all of them are optional. Keep local regulations in mind though when populating these (PII laws, GDPR, etc.).

==== Adding a Payment Method

To trigger payments, Kill Bill will need to integrate with a payment provider (such as Stripe or PayPal). Each means of payment (e.g. a credit card) will have a *payment method* associated with it.

For simplicity in this tutorial, we will assume your customers send you checks. To create the payment method in Kaui, click the + next to Payment Methods on the main account page. The plugin name should be set to $$__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__$$, leave all other fields blank and make sure the checkbox Default Payment Method is checked.

Once you are ready to integrate with a real payment processor, all you'll have to do is to create a new payment method for that account. The rest of this tutorial will still apply.

==== Creating Your First Subscription

Let's now try to subscribe a user to the Standard plan. This is the call that would need to be triggered from your website, when the user chooses the premium plan on the subscription checkout page.

In Kaui, click the Subscriptions tab then the + by *Subscription Bundles* (a subscription bundle is a collection, a _bundle_, of subscriptions, containing one base subscription and zero or more add-ons). Select the `standard-monthly` plan in the dropdown. You can also specify an optional (but unique) key to identify this subscription.

Because there is no trial period and because billing is performed in advance by default, Kill Bill will have automatically billed the user for the first month.

You should see the invoice and the payment by clicking on the Invoices and Payments tabs.

Kill Bill will now automatically charge the user on a monthly basis. You can estimate the amount which will be billed at a future date by triggering a dry-run invoice. On the main account page, in the Billing Info section, click the *Trigger invoice generation* wand (specify a date at least a month in the future).
