This section explains how to configure Kill Bill using Kaui, the back-office user interface.

As part of getting familiar with Kaui, we'll walk you through the steps of creating a tenant, setting up a simple catalog, followed by creating an account in Kaui. Next, you'll learn how to assign a payment method to the account and subscribe the account to a plan. Finally, you'll be able to view the generated invoice and payment.

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have https://docs.killbill.io/latest/install-kb-and-kaui.html[installed Kill Bill and Kaui]. 

[NOTE]
*Note:* You can also achieve these same results of this tutorial with the API. For more information, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/set-up-kb-with-the-api.html[Set Up Kill Bill with the API].

== Before You Begin

Start up Kaui and log in as explained in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/install-kb-and-kaui.html[installation manual]. 

== Step 1. Create a Tenant (First-Time Login)

Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy, where each tenant has its own data, configuration, and so forth. This section explains how to create a tenant the first time you log in to Kaui.

. The first time you log in, Kaui prompts you to create a tenant: 
+

+
. Fill in the fields:
+
* *Name* refers to the tenant name.
* For *API Key*, use `bob`, and for *API Secret*, use `lazar` in the rest of this guide.
+
. Click the *Save* button. 

After you create a tenant, the active tenant name appears in the upper right corner of the Kaui screen:

== Step 2. Create a Simple Catalog with Two Plans

The Kill Bill *catalog* contains products and plans definitions. This XML configuration file is really powerful and offers various options for handling trials, add-ons, upgrades/downgrades, and so forth. For more details on its features, read http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[_Subscription Billing_].

For this tutorial, instead of starting with the XML catalog, you'll learn how to create a simple catalog in Kaui and configure it with two plans. Note that this is _a subset_ of what is supported through XML configuration and isn't necessarily intended to serve as a catalog in production. For more details on the simple catalog, see the https://killbill.github.io/slate/#catalog-simple-plan["Simple Plan"] section in the _API Reference_.

To create the simple catalog and two plans: 

. Click the tenant name in the upper right corner: 
+
image::select-tenant-name.png[width=850,align="center"]
+
Kaui opens the Tenant Configuration page. 
+
. Scroll to the bottom:  
+
image::tenant-config-labeled.png[width=850,align="center"]
+
. Click the plus sign next to Existing Plans.
+
image::add-simple-catalog.png[width=250,align="center"]
+
Kaui opens the Catalog Configuration screen. 
+
. Fill in the fields as shown below: 
+
image::catalog-standard-free.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Click the *Save* button. 
+
Kaui returns to the Tenant Configuration screen. 
+
. Click the plus sign again. 
+
. On the Catalog Configuration screen, fill in the fields as shown below:
+
image::catalog-standard-monthly.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Click the *Save* button. 
+
Kaui returns to the Tenant Configuration screen. 
+
You will now see the two plans you have created. Note that when you created the first plan, Kaui created the simple catalog:
+
image::simple-catalog-two-plans-labeled.png[width=850,align="center"]

== Step 3. Create the First Account

In this section, we will create a customer account, which stores the data your organization deems necessary for transacting with a customer.

. At the top of any Kaui screen, click *Create New Account.*
+
Kaui opens the Add New Account screen.
+ 
. Fill in *Name* field as shown:
+
image::create-new-account.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Scroll down the page and click the *Save* button. 
+
Kaui displays the customer name for the new account at the top left of the screen:
+
image::account-name-labeled.png[width=450,align="center"]  


* The Kill Bill *External key* field should map to the unique id of the account in your system (should be unique and immutable). Kill Bill will auto-generate an id if you don't populate this field


* There are many more fields you can store (phone number, address, etc.) -- all of them are optional. Keep local regulations in mind though when populating these (PII laws, GDPR, etc.).

== Step 5. Add a Payment Method

To trigger payments, Kill Bill will need to integrate with a payment provider (such as Stripe or PayPal). Each means of payment (e.g. a credit card) will have a *payment method* associated with it.

For simplicity in this tutorial, we will assume your customers send you checks. To create the payment method in Kaui, click the + next to Payment Methods on the main account page. The plugin name should be set to $$__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__$$, leave all other fields blank and make sure the checkbox Default Payment Method is checked.

Once you are ready to integrate with a real payment processor, all you'll have to do is to create a new payment method for that account. The rest of this tutorial will still apply.

== Step 6. Create Your First Subscription

Let's now try to subscribe a user to the Standard plan. This is the call that would need to be triggered from your website, when the user chooses the premium plan on the subscription checkout page.

In Kaui, click the Subscriptions tab then the + by *Subscription Bundles* (a subscription bundle is a collection, a _bundle_, of subscriptions, containing one base subscription and zero or more add-ons). Select the `standard-monthly` plan in the dropdown. You can also specify an optional (but unique) key to identify this subscription.

Because there is no trial period and because billing is performed in advance by default, Kill Bill will have automatically billed the user for the first month.

You should see the invoice and the payment by clicking on the Invoices and Payments tabs.

Kill Bill will now automatically charge the user on a monthly basis. You can estimate the amount which will be billed at a future date by triggering a dry-run invoice. On the main account page, in the Billing Info section, click the *Trigger invoice generation* wand (specify a date at least a month in the future).
