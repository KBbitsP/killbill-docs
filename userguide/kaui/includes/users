ORIGINAL KAUI MAT'L:

The management of the users that can access the api along with their roles and associated permissions is managed by Kill Bill server through the shiro layer. Such users must be configured on the server side in order to be available from KAUI and the assumption here is that those already exists on the server side. Please refer to our user management guide.

KAUI contains a default admin user (and by default Kill Bill also contains such an admin user with its associated password password, which has the root role containing all permissions). This allows to login to KAUI and bootstrap the KAUI configuration (without having to run manual SQL by hand for instance).

The first stage is to login using the default admin user:

When login-in, KAUI will check whether some tenants have been configured for this user:

If no tenant current exist for this user, you will be prompted to add a new tenant (next section)

If only one tenant exists for this user, KAUI will automatically select that tenant as the default tenant

If only more than one tenant exists for this user, KAUI will prompt for a tenant to chose (note that cross tenant operations such as adding new users or tenants can still happen as long as the user has the priviledges to do so).

Upon login success one will see the following screen:

Assuming now, we have another user demo already configured on the server side, and we want to make it available in KAUI. The previous screenshot shows the menu USERS that allows to add new users known to KAUI. By clicking on that link, one will see the existing users known to KAUI and by clicking on the + button, will have the option to add a new user. Letâ€™s make the demo user known to KAUI:

Upon success, one will see the following screen, and will be able to select the existing tenant(s) that this user can manage:
