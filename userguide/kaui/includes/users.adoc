== Overview

In this guide, "users" refers to those who log in to Kaui to perform actions (add a charge, generate a dry-run invoice, etc.). However, other parts of the documentation also use the term "user" when referring to users of the API.

In order for users to be able to log in and perform tasks in Kaui, you need to create a user profile for each one.

This section explains how to manage users in Kaui, which includes:

* Creating and editing new users
* Assigning roles and tenants to users
* Adding new user roles

This section assumes that you can log in as a Kaui admin or as a user with the correct permissions for working with users, roles, and permissions.

== Additional Resources

For additional information on managing users, roles, and permissions in Kill Bill, see the following:

* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[Users, Roles, and Permissions Management]

* https://killbill.io/blog/multi-tenancy-authorization/[Multi-Tenancy and Authorization]

* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-api/blob/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/security/Permission.java[List of user permissions]

=== Managing Users with a Third-Party System

If you are managing users with a third-party system, all that's required in Kaui is to add the username per the <<Add a User>> section.

=== Managing Users with Kill Bill

If you are managing users with the Kill Bill database _or_ solely with the `shiro.ini` file, first define the users and roles as described in https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[Users, Roles, and Permissions Management]. Then, in Kaui, you must create the same users, passwords, etc. For more information, see <<Add a User>> and <<Edit a User>>.

// ADD "Permissions" and "User Role" to Glossary
// Permissions:: A list of operations that can be performed in the system (for example, `CREATE_USER` or `INVOICE_CAN_CREDIT`). A Kill Bill or Kaui administrator can assign permissions to roles, which are then assigned to users to control users' access to the system.

== Before You Begin

If your organization uses a third-party system, such as LDAP, Okta, or Auth0, to manage Kill Bill users and roles, first configure them in that system, then add them in Kaui. For more information, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[Users, Roles, and Permissions Management].

If you are using the Kill Bill database to store user data, adding a user profile to in Kaui automatically creates it in Kill Bill. **NOT SURE ABOUT THIS

== Create a New User Role

The role(s) assigned to a user define what tasks the user can perform in the system (for example, perform a chargeback or add a custom field).

. Open the Add New Role Definition screen, either from the User Update screen (see <<Edit a User>>) or by accessing `https://demo.killbill.io/role_definitions/new`.
