This section explains how to manage users in Kaui. "Users" in this sense refers to those who log in to Kaui to perform actions (add a charge, generate a dry-run invoice, etc.).

The steps below assume you can log in as a Kaui admin (which has all permissions) or as a user with the associated permisions for working with users, roles, and permisions.


== Overview

QSTS:
How do I get access to the screen that lets you map users to tenants
As mary@kill-bill.org user, do I need more permissions to see the gears icon at the top of the screen? Or can I access with a special URL address?

== Before You Begin

To create users, you need to have the correct permissions. The default Kaui `admin` rule has user creation permissions (and can assign these permissions to other users if necessary).

User, roles, permissions need to be configured on the server side (shiro.ini, database, LDAP, Okta/Auth0, …​) ...

The management of the users that can access the api along with their roles and associated permissions is managed by Kill Bill server through the shiro layer. Such users must be configured on the server side in order to be available from KAUI and the assumption here is that those already exists on the server side. Please refer to our user management guide.

Please refer to our user management guide.

Kaui needs to be told about the relationship between user and tenants (this mapping is specific to the UI). The idea, is that a super admin would first configure the allowed users for each specific tenant on the KAUI side, in such a way that later on, when a specific user logs in, he only sees the tenants he has access to.

This mapping can be configured by going to each user page (e.g. /admin_allowed_users/1).

== Add New User Field Descriptions

LDAP, Okta, and Auth0
If you are delegating roles and users management to a third-party system, Kaui only needs to know the login of the users. Password and roles being managed outside of Kill Bill, you need to access your third-party system to set and update these.

Note that there is no auto-discovery of logins: you need to enter all logins from your system manually in Kaui before such users can access the UI (check the box "Managed externally" when adding these users).

ORIGINAL KAUI MAT'L:

The management of the users that can access the api along with their roles and associated permissions is managed by Kill Bill server through the shiro layer. Such users must be configured on the server side in order to be available from KAUI and the assumption here is that those already exists on the server side. Please refer to our user management guide.

KAUI contains a default admin user (and by default Kill Bill also contains such an admin user with its associated password password, which has the root role containing all permissions). This allows to login to KAUI and bootstrap the KAUI configuration (without having to run manual SQL by hand for instance).

The first stage is to login using the default admin user:

SCREENSHOT

When login-in, KAUI will check whether some tenants have been configured for this user:

If no tenant current exist for this user, you will be prompted to add a new tenant (next section)

If only one tenant exists for this user, KAUI will automatically select that tenant as the default tenant

If only more than one tenant exists for this user, KAUI will prompt for a tenant to chose (note that cross tenant operations such as adding new users or tenants can still happen as long as the user has the priviledges to do so).

Upon login success one will see the following screen:

SCREENSHOT

Assuming now, we have another user demo already configured on the server side, and we want to make it available in KAUI. The previous screenshot shows the menu USERS that allows to add new users known to KAUI. By clicking on that link, one will see the existing users known to KAUI and by clicking on the + button, will have the option to add a new user. Let’s make the demo user known to KAUI:

SCREENSHOT

Upon success, one will see the following screen, and will be able to select the existing tenant(s) that this user can manage:
