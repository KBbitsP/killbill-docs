=== What Is Kaui?
"Kaui" (KAUI) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface. This self-contained web application interacts with Kill Bill over HTTPS.

Backoffice staff (for example, Support or Finance) will find Kaui useful to process refunds, credits, chargebacks, and so forth. Kaui also enables the Kill Bill administrator to perform more advanced tasks, such as managing tags, deploying plugins, and configuring the tenant(s).

Other types of users who might find Kaui useful are developers (for testing), operations, and product managers.

[NOTE]
*Note:* For Developers: Kaui functionality is provided via a series of Ruby on Rails mountable engines. You can extend its functionality (for example, to provide a custom UI for your plugins) by mounting your own engine(s).

=== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Create a customer account
* Generate a customer invoice
* Cancel a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the _Table of Contents_ at the beginning of this guide.

==== Grids/Tables [[grids_tables]]
Grids (also referred to as _tables_) appear throughout Kaui to keep lists organized:

image::../assets/img/kaui/GridSample.png[align="center"]

For very large grids, use the pagination controls to view different "pages:"

image::../assets/img/kaui/PaginationControls.png[80,500,align="center"]

[%unbreakable]
--
To sort columns on a grid, click the up/down arrow in that column's header:

image::../assets/img/kaui/ShowSortArrowsOnColumn.png[width=650,align="center"]
--

Kaui shows you which column is currently sorted by the purple arrow:

image::../assets/img/kaui/ShowSortByColumn.png[width=650,align="center"]

The direction of the arrow (up or down) indicates if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.

If relevant, you can click a link in the grid to view that item's detail. For example, on the Invoices grid, click the link to open that specific invoice:

image::../assets/img/kaui/ClickToViewDetail.png[width=650,align="center"]

==== Basic Search

[TIP]
*Tip:* To view all accounts, place your cursor in the search field and press the Enter key.
