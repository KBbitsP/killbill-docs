=== Overview

Kill Bill offers the ability to tag resources (account, invoice, payment, subscription, etc.) in the system. YOu can tag most objects in Kill Bill.

Kill Bill supports two types of tags:

* *User tags*&#8212;These tags are not interpreted by the system; they are a convenient way for admins or third-party systems to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resources associated with a specific customer to group them. You can add, change, and delete user tags in Kaui.

* *Control tags*&#8212;These tags modify the behavior of the system. You cannot add, change, or delete control tags.

For a complete list of system tags, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-tag["Tags"] section in the __Subscription Guide__

To see the tags list, select the tags icon at the top of the screen, then select either Tags (for user tags) or Tag Definitions (for control tags):
