=== Overview

In Kaui, you can apply one or more tags to accounts and invoices, a tag being a single value. Tags in Kill Bill can be used to convey information about an object type. A tag can just provide information about an object (user tag) or it can actually affect how the object is handled in Kill Bill (control tag).

This section explains how to attach tags to accounts and invoices. It also describes the steps for creating the tag definitions on which a tag is based.

[NOTE]
*Note:* You can use the API to attach tags to even more object types, such as payments and subscriptions. For more information, see the "Tags" section of the relevant object type (for example, Payments) in the https://killbill.github.io/slate/[API Reference].

==== Types of Tags

Kill Bill has two types of tags:

* *Control tags*&#8212;Also referred to as _system tags_, these tags modify the behavior of the system. In Kaui, you can view and attach these tags, but you cannot add, change, or delete the underlying <<Add Tag Definition, tag definition>>. Kill Bill includes several control tags; see the API documentation for https://killbill.github.io/slate/#tag[a list].

* *User tags*&#8212;These tags are not interpreted by Kill Bill; they are a way for admins or third-party systems to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resources associated with a specific customer to group them. In Kaui, you can create and delete user tags on the <<Add Tag Definition, Tag Definition page>>.

[NOTE]
*Note:* Kill Bill does not include default user tags.

==== About Tag Definitions

A tag is based on a _tag definition_. As its name implies, a _tag definition_ defines information about a specific tag. In Kaui, you must create a tag definition for a user tag before you can attach it to an account or invoice.

=== View Object Types That Have Attached Tags

This section explains how to view object types that have attached tags. You can view _all_ the objects with tags for the current tenant; you can also view the tags for a specific account (or invoice).

To see a list of _all_ the objects in the tenant that have a tag attached, select the tag icon at the top of the screen, then select *Tags*:

image::C:\_My Documents\FlowWritingLLC\Projects\Kill Bill\Documentation\killbill-docs\userguide\assets\img\kaui\TagDropdown-Tags.png[width=150,align="center"]
+
_Here I could use a screenshot of a lot of different accounts/invoices with tags._
+
[TIP]
*Tip:* On the Tags page, you can open the object (account, invoice, etc.) by clicking the link in the Object ID column.

To see any tags assigned to a specific account (or invoice), open the account and click *Tags* on the sub-menu. Kaui opens the Tags page and displays only the tags assigned to that account or its related invoice.
