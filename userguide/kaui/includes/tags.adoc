=== Overview

Kill Bill provides the ability to tag most object types (account, invoice, payment, subscription, etc.) in the system. A tag is a single value that you can attach to a record. In Kaui, you can view the available tags and also perform the actual tagging.

Kill Bill has two types of tags:

* *Control tags*&#8212;Also referred to as _system tags_, these tags modify the behavior of the system.  You cannot add, change, or delete control tags. For a list of system tags, see the <<Tag Definition Page, Tag Definition page>>.

* *User tags*&#8212;These tags are not interpreted by the system; they are a way for admins or third-party systems to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resources associated with a specific customer to group them.

[NOTE]
*Note:* Kill Bill does not include default user tags. To define user tags, use the API. For more information, see the https://killbill.github.io/slate/#tag-definition["Tag Definition"] section.

[TIP]
*Tip:* On the Tags page, you can open the object (account, invoice, etc.) by clicking on the link in the Object ID column.

To see any tags assigned to an account (or invoices), open the account and click *Tags* on the sub-menu. The Tags page displays only the tags assigned to that account or invoice.
