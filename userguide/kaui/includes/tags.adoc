=== Overview

Kill Bill provides the ability to tag resources (account, invoice, payment, subscription, etc.) in the system. A tag is a single value that you can attach to a record. You can tag most object types in Kill Bill.

Kill Bill supports two types of tags:

* *User tags*&#8212;These tags are not interpreted by the system; they are a convenient way for admins or third-party systems to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resources associated with a specific customer to group them. You can add, change, and delete user tags in Kaui.

* *Control tags*&#8212;These tags modify the behavior of the system. You cannot add, change, or delete control tags. These tags are also referred to as _system tags_. A list of these tags are provided on the <<Create a Tag Definition, Tag Definition page>>, but for more information on them, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-tag["Tags"] section in the __Subscription Guide__

To see a list of user tags, select the tags icon at the top of the screen, then select Tags:

This chapter explains how to create, change, or delete user tags in Kaui. Note that before you add a user tag, you must first <<Create a Tag Definition, create a tag definition>>.
