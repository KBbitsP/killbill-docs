=== Overview

In Kaui, you can create custom fields (key/value pairs). Via the API, these custom fields can be attached to objects like accounts, payments, and so forth. This additional information can extend Kill Bill's functionality when used with custom plugins or third-party applications.

Kill Bill does not include default user tags, but you can add and manage them in Kaui.
