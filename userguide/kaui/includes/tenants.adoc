=== Overview

Kill Bill is a multi-tenancy system, which means that you can have multiple instances of Kill Bill running on your server(s). This is an excellent method for running both production and test versions of Kill Bill. Another multi-tenancy use case is to use a different tenant for the different regions that make up your business.

[IMPORTANT]
*Important:* If you have already created tenants using the API, you must also add them in Kaui in order for Kaui to recognize them.

=== Create a Tenant

When you log in to Kaui for the first time, you are prompted to create your first tenant with the Add New Tenant screen (shown below).

After the first-time login, you can create additional tenants by following these steps:

. At the top of the screen, click the gears icon ( image:../assets/img/kaui/i_gears.png[]) and select *Tenants*.
+

Kaui displays a list of tenants on the Tenants screen:
+
NEED SCREENSHOT
+
. Click the plus sign ( image:../assets/img/kaui/i_PlusGreen.png[] ) next to *Kaui Tenants*.
+
Kaui displays the Add New Tenant screen:
+
image::../assets/img/kaui/AddNewTenant.png[width=450,align="center"]
+
. Type in the tenant *Name*, *API Key*, and *API Secret*.
+
[NOTE]
 *Note:*The API key and API secret pair is used in all HTTP requests to ensure that the user issuing the request has the correct permissions to access the tenant.
+
. Click the *Save* button.
+
Kaui displays the Tenant Configuration page with the new tenant name in the upper right corner: <--QST: AFTER THE 1ST TENANT IS CREATED, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. BUT IS IT ALSO TRUE FOR TENANTS CREATED AFTER THAT? IT'S POSSIBLE THE LIST OF TENANTS IS DISPLAYED INSTEAD. PLEASE CONFIRM.
