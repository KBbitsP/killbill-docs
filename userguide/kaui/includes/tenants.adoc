=== Overview

Kill Bill is a multi-tenancy system, which means that you can have multiple instances of Kill Bill running on your server(s). This is an excellent method for running both production and test versions of Kill Bill. Another multi-tenancy use case is to use a different tenant for the different regions that make up your business.

[IMPORTANT]
*Important:* If you have already created tenants using the API, you must also add them in Kaui in order for Kaui to recognize them.

=== First-Time Login &#8211; Create a Tenant

After installing Kill Bill, when you log in to Kaui for the first time, you are prompted to create your first tenant:

image::../assets/img/kaui/AddNewTenant.png[width=350,align="center"]

. Type in the tenant *Name*, *API Key*, and *API Secret*.
+
 The API key and API secret pair is used in all HTTP requests to ensure that the user issuing the request has the correct permissions to access the tenant.
+
. Click the *Save* button. Kaui displays the Tenant Configuration page with the new tenant name in the upper right corner:
