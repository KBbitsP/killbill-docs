* Software development environments (coding, testing, production, etc.)
* Product lines (brick-and-mortar, online ecommerce, etc.)
* Regions (north, southeast, central, etc.)

[IMPORTANT]
*Important:* If you have already created tenants using the API, you must also add them in Kaui in order for Kaui to recognize them.
